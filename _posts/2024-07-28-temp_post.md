TF-IDF measures the importance of a word to a document in a corpus of documents. It is used as a ranking function - given a query and a corpus of documents, the documents are ranked by summing the scores of the query words. 
For a corpus <span>$D={d_1, d_2, ..., d_n}$</span> of n documents and a query $q={t_1, t_2, ... t_m}$ of m terms, the score of a document $d_k, k \in {1, ..., n}$ is: $\sum_{i \in \{1, ..., m\}} tf\_idf(t_i, d_k)$
